    You probably noticed that the button in the last exercise didn't actually <i>do</i> anything. Let's fix that! JavaScript is used to make elements of HTML 
    (like buttons) interactive. In this exercise, use a button to show/hide some text that the user inputs. This exercise is a little trickier, but you can do it!
    <br><br>
    First, you'll have to include a textarea box. This is basically a textbox that allows the user to input some text. Like all HTML elements, the textarea box
    is made with opening and closing tags. The opening tag for a textarea box is: &lttextarea&gt. In between the tags, you can display some default text for the
    textarea box. You'll want to give your textarea box an id that you can use to reference the box in your code. This is done by including &quotid=&quot and the name
    you want to assign the box. This name is not visible to the user. The code line should look something like this: <br>
    &lttextarea id = "nameOfTextAreaBox"&gt Default Text Here &lt/textarea&gt <br><br>

    Next, create a button! You've already done this, but now there's one extra step. In the same way we included an 'id' attribute for our textarea box, 
    you'll want to include an &quotonclick=&quote attribute for our button. This is where you tell your button what JavaScript function to call when it's clicked
    (Note, you haven't written this function yet!). The formatting looks something like this: <br>
    &ltbutton onclick="Yourfunction()"&gt Text Here &lt/button&gt <br><br>

    Then, create an empty text line with paragraph formating (&ltp&gt). Give your text an id, just like you did with the textarea box! <br><br>
    
    Now for the final step, the JavaScript function! Anytime you wish to include JavaScript in your code, you have to use the opening and closing tags 
    &ltscript&gt and &lt/script&gt. Inside these tags, you can type your function! JavaScript functions look similar to functions in other code languages: <br><br>
    function functionName() { <br>
         *Type your function here*<br>
    }
	<br><br>
    Inside your function use these lines of code (with some adjustment): <br>
    var x = document.getElementById("YourTextareaBoxID").value; <br>
    document.getElementById("YourParagraphTextID").innerHTML = x; <br>

    The first line gets the user input from the textbox and assigns it to variable x. The second line assigns the variable x to your paragraph text
    so that the paragraph text now has the user input! This only occurs when the user clicks the button, however. 
    Notice that the textarea box and paragraph text are referenced by their ids. <br><br>
    
    Try combining all of the steps above to complete this exercise! Run your code at each step to make sure that it seems to be working (HTML is difficult
    to debug, unfortunately). See the sample below for what the output should look like.
