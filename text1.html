    		Creating a title for your page is easy! <br>
    		Inside the <head> tag, to indicate you want to put a title, the tag is: &lttitle&gt. Inside the tags write whatever title you want! <br>
 		EX: &lttitle&gt How to Give a Page a Title &lt/title&gt<br>

    		Note!!<br>
      		A tittle after a body is not valid. Even though you can omit the HEAD tag, it is implied when you start a TITLE tag. And the HEAD tag has to be the first tag inside the HTML tag. <br>
      		A title at the end implies a head at the end, which makes your document invalid.<br>
		<br>
		Try creating your own title! <br>
