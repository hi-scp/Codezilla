    		Creating a title for your page is easy!
    		Inside the <head> tag, to indicate you want to put a title, the tag is: <title>. Inside the tags write whatever title you want!
 		EX: &lttitle&gt How to Give a Page a Title &lt/title&gt

    		Note!!
      		A tittle after a body is not valid. Even though you can omit the HEAD tag, it is implied when you start a TITLE tag. And the HEAD tag has to be the first tag inside the HTML tag. 
      		A title at the end implies a head at the end, which makes your document invalid.

		Try creating your own title!
